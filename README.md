To gain deeper insights into our client's call center operations and enhance overall performance, I developed a PowerBI dashboard that analyzes key trends in call center activities. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of metrics such as call volumes, response times, customer satisfaction scores, and agent performance, offering a clear understanding of the factors that impact our call center's efficiency and service quality.
The insights derived from this dashboard will inform our strategies to optimize call center operations, improve customer service, and implement targeted training programs for agents. This data-driven approach will ultimately help us enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and ensure our call center meets the highest standards of service quality
